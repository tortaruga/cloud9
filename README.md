fictitious travelling agency website that i had way too much fun creating considering it serves no purpose at all.

##### notes

tailwindcss practice. 
i'm still not sure whether i like tailwind or not: it's quite useful now that i'm more familiar with it, but it makes the html a bit messy, and my computer slows down a bit when i use it.

this project is a remake of an old exercise, and while design is still not my strong suit i'm pretty happy with the result. i guess any progress is progress after all.
